## SNHU Software Development ePortfolio
My name is Christina and I am attaining a Bachelor's of Science from Southern New Hampshire University studying software engineering. Below is a showcase of my capstone work and narratives for each project to present what I was able to create and my learning process.

## Code Review

Here is the link to the code review I performed on three artifacts I worked on while pursuing my education at Southern New Hampshire University studying computer science. [click here](https://youtu.be/KW-qXvNUJ6U) to view this in YouTube.

## Software Design and Engineering Enhancement
(include Blender, ASSIMP, OpenGL, C++)

For my first artifact, I worked on improving my final project from my CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course. For that course’s final project, I built a 3D cheeseburger with the ability to change the visual perspective by the user. Using hotkeys, the user could zoom towards and away from the object as well as pan around the burger. I took this course during the 20EW4 term.

I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio, because I was excited to work on creating a better version of my 3D object. It would allow me to practice writing in C++, learn more about OpenGL, and work with the ASSIMP library.

I met the course I objectives I planned for myself with these enhancement. I implemented techniques and design skills to import data from an obj file in order to improve the rendering of the object. My previous work included pain-stakingly typing in every vertex point of every triangle that comprised my cheeseburger. Unsurprisingly, there were missing sides.

## Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement
(python, MongoDB)

For my second artifact, I worked on improving my final project from my CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts course. For that course’s final project, we needed to create a RESTful API web service using Python and MongoDB to implement a Stock Market program. I took this course during the 20EW5 term.

I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio in order to gain more experience writing code in Python and work with MongoDB. Moreover, I wanted practice with working with other python packages. This project required using the yfinance package, pymongo, and the Bottle framework. Bottle is a good choice for creating small applications to create a quick prototype. For future projects, I plan to learn and incorporate using Flask and Django as these are more popular frameworks due to scalability, simplicity, and power/capabilities.

I met the course objectives and goals I created and the beginning of this term. I was able to use my skills and techniques to employ iterative testing techniques in my code. I was able to use the software development life cycle to create realistic production schedules for software projects. I was able to create an industry-standard software design. I made sure each function had a clear description if it needed one. I was able to create more robust and efficient code to deliver value and accomplish my industry-specific goals.

## Databases Enhancement
(MySQL)

For my third artifact, I worked on explanding the knowledge-base and skills I gained from my DAD 220: Introduction to SQL course. For that course’s final project, we were required to create a new database from scratch, consisting of multiple tables. We also needed to populate the database, update records, and delete existing records to show our ability to implement CRUD function. We also created specific queries that applied to previous assignments.

I included this project into my ePortfolio, because I really enjoyed working with SQL databases. I also had a great experience taking that course, and I know SQL and MongoDB are among the top databases to work with in the computer science and information careers.

I met the course I objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. I was able to use my skills and techniques to implement design solutions and accomplish the goals I set for myself. I set solutions to solve logic problems in my software as well as notice potential design flaws related to security. I wanted to ensure that the user could easily take my code and understand everything that they were looking at. I made sure each function had a clear description if it needed one.
